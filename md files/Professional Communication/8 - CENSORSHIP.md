## Internet censorship
*define internet censorship, name some of the forms it can take, and discuss how it can be achieved as well as combatted*
#### Internet censorship
**Internet censorship** refers to the control or restriction of content available on the internet by governments, organizations, or other entities. It involves blocking, filtering, or limiting access to specific websites, information, or online activities to suppress certain viewpoints, protect users, or maintain security.
#### Forms
- **Content Blocking** - Restricting access to certain websites, apps, or online platforms (e.g., social media, news sites).
- **Filtering** - Using software or algorithms to prevent users from viewing specific content based on keywords, categories, or topics.
- **Deep ban** - a severe form of online ban that blocks a user not just from their account, but also from the platform itself, often by targeting their IP address, devices, and other identifying information to prevent them from evading the ban

#### How it can be achieved
- **Content Moderation** - Government or platform administrators may force the removal of specific content from websites, social media platforms, or forums. This may involve direct censorship requests to site owners or automatic content moderation tools.
- **Legislation**  Governments pass laws and regulations that mandate internet censorship, such as forcing ISPs to block access to certain content or requiring companies to monitor and remove content.
	- **bill from internet falsehood & manipulations** - dubbed anti-social media bill. Would regulate social media much the way they do in China.
- **Deep ban** / **Deep Packet Inspection** (DPI): This method involves analyzing the data sent over the internet at a granular level to block or restrict certain types of content. It can be used to detect and block websites, services, or even specific words and phrases in communication.
- **Firewall Technologies** - Many countries use "Great Firewalls" (e.g., China’s Great Firewall) that monitor and block internet traffic, denying access to information from outside the country or preventing certain types of domestic content.
- **domestic internet**


#### How it can be combated
- **Use of VPNs** - VPNs can help users bypass censorship by routing internet traffic through servers in different countries, making it appear as if they are accessing the internet from a different location where censorship is not enforced.

## The great firewall -- domestic internet
*explain The Great Firewall and the concept of domestic internet*
#### The great firewall
The Great Firewall refers to China’s extensive system of internet censorship and surveillance. It is a combination of legal regulations, technological tools, and monitoring systems used by the Chinese government to control and restrict access to foreign websites, online content, and social media platforms. The goal is to limit the flow of information that the government deems harmful or contrary to its policies. it includes:
- Blocking access to popular websites (e.g., Facebook, Google, and Twitter).
- Filtering and monitoring online content based on keywords, topics, or political views.
- Preventing VPNs and circumvention tools to maintain control over internet traffic.

#### Domestic internet
A domestic internet refers to a national or regional version of the internet that is isolated from the global web. The internet is heavily regulated to ensure that users primarily access domestic websites and services (like Baidu, WeChat, and Alibaba) rather than foreign ones. This creates a closed ecosystem where:
- Information flow is controlled within the country.
- Foreign influence is limited, as access to external platforms is restricted or filtered.
- Local alternatives are promoted, with companies and services that comply with government regulations thriving in the domestic internet space.

# 2 - Content Moderators
*explain content moderation in detail*

**Content moderation** is the process of overseeing and managing the content that users post on online platforms to ensure it follows the rules and guidelines set by the platform. This includes removing or restricting harmful, inappropriate, or illegal content, such as hate speech, violence, or explicit material. 

There are different **methods** of moderation:
- **Manual moderation**: Human moderators review content and decide whether it’s acceptable or not.
- **Automated moderation**: Algorithms or AI tools scan content and flag or remove things that break the rules.
- **Hybrid moderation**: A combination of both, where automated tools handle simple tasks, and humans deal with more complex decisions.

The goal is to create a safe and respectful online environment, but it can be tricky because balancing safety with freedom of speech is challenging.
