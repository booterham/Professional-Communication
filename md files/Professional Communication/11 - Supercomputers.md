# supercomputers, quantum computing and NISQ
### **Supercomputers**:
Supercomputer: any of a class of extremely powerful computers. The term is commonly applied to the fastest high-performance systems available at any given time. Such computers have been used primarily for mathematical and engineering work requiring exceedingly high-speed computations. Common applications for supercomputers include testing, scientific models for complex physical phenomena or designs, such as climate and weather, evolution of the cosmos, nuclear weapons and reactors, new chemical compounds (especially for pharmaceutical purposes) and cryptology. As the costs of supercomputing decline in 1990's, more businisses began to use supercomputers for market research and other business related models.

### **Quantum Computing**:
Quantum computing is a revolutionary approach to computing that uses **quantum bits (qubits)** instead of traditional bits. Qubits can represent 0, 1, or both simultaneously (a property called superposition), allowing quantum computers to solve certain problems much faster than classical computers. They excel in fields like cryptography, material science, and optimization but are still in experimental stages.

Key features of quantum computing:
- **Superposition**: Qubits can exist in multiple states at once.
- **Entanglement**: Qubits can be linked, so the state of one qubit affects the other, no matter the distance.
- **Interference**: Quantum systems use interference to amplify correct solutions and cancel out errors.

### **NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum)**:
NISQ refers to the current era of quantum computing, characterized by intermediate-sized quantum computers (50–100 qubits) that are still noisy and error-prone. These machines aren’t yet powerful enough for full-scale quantum computing but can tackle specialized problems beyond the reach of classical computers. The NISQ era focuses on:
- Developing algorithms that tolerate noise.
- Exploring early applications like quantum chemistry and machine learning.
- Refining hardware to reduce errors and scale up for future breakthroughs. 

In short, NISQ represents the transition phase between experimental quantum devices and practical, large-scale quantum computers.

# Two phenomena of quantum computing
Quantum computers are fundamentally different from classical computers because of two unique quantum phenomena: **superposition** and **entanglement**.

1. **Superposition**: While classical bits can only exist as either 0 or 1, qubits in a quantum computer can exist in both states simultaneously. This allows quantum computers to perform many calculations at once. For example, with \( n \) qubits, a quantum computer can explore \( 2^n \) possibilities at the same time, providing immense parallelism compared to classical computers, which process tasks sequentially.

2. **Entanglement**: Qubits can become entangled, meaning the state of one qubit is directly linked to another, even over large distances. This allows quantum computers to perform highly coordinated operations efficiently, something classical computers cannot achieve.

These phenomena enable quantum computers to excel at tasks like cryptography, optimization, and simulating quantum systems, where classical computers are slow or ineffective. While classical computers are still better for general-purpose computing, quantum computers have the potential to solve specific, complex problems much faster.
